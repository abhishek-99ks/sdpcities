        <p>Fashion Street is a renowned spot for shopping in Pune. It is a street market located in one of the prime locations in the city. Here, one can find a variety of products to suit their requirement. Fashion Street is often crowded as the prices are extremely affordable. Plus, customers can always bargain. Like most street markets, the shops and the kiosks are placed closed to each other on either side of the street. The narrow lane that remains in the middle of the street is used by the customers who dodge and find a way through the crowd. Peak hours of the day draw people for shopping in large numbers. One may want to visit Fashion Street a little early to explore it completely.</p>
